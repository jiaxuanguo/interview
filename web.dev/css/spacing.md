## [Spacing](https://web.dev/learn/css/spacing/)

- html spacing: `br`(break) and `hr`(horizontal rule); use for their semantics
- `margin`s: space outside box
  - `auto` to occupy all available space
  - percentages are relative to parent's width
  - use negative values to reduce space between elements; usually results in overlapping
  - **vertical margins** may [collapse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing)
- `padding`s: space inside box
- positions
- `gap` of grid and flexbox
- make sure spacing is consistent across the website/app
