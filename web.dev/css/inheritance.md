# [Inheritance](https://web.dev/learn/css/inheritance/)

- children can inherit some styles from parent
- only some css properties can be inherited; most of them are typography related
- > Every HTML element has every CSS property defined by default with an initial value
- force inheritance by setting value to `inherit`; this can be done to **any** css property
- break from inheritance by setting value to `initial`
- `unset` means `inherit` if property is inheritable, `initial` if not; this is usually used to override a previous rule
