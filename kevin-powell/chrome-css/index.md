~~had to include this one~~
### firefox has better support for css inspection
1. tells you why a valid rule is not working as intended, and even offer suggestions
2. dom inspector shows attached event handlers
3. a fonts tab that lists all fonts used in page and style details of the selected element
4. a style editor to modify css files in situ
