# [The problem with browser defaults and the future of resets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4wPV-K1lNI)

- browsers have different default styles
- there's a once popular css reset that striped away almost all user-agent styles
- normalize.css provides consistent and reasonable default styling of elements across browsers
- there are some more opinionated resets: sanitize, reboot etc.
- normalize is the bare minimum, so an opinionated reset may be a better starting point
- css remedy is like a polyfill for modern css; ongoing project
