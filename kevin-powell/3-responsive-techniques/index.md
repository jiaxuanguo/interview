- responsive column width with the `min` function, providing at least a percentage value and a numeric value; this sets a fixed maximum width
- responsive padding and margin with the `max` function; this sets a fixed minimum padding/margin size
- set both maximum and minimum with `clamp`; use it on font-sizes
